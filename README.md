# Description
This is a simple weather app displaying a weather data of five days. In order to make this, I have used two API's:

1.For accessing the location coordinates(latitude and longitude)
2.For getting the weather information

## API used:

1. [For Location](http://loactioniq.org)

2. [For Weather](http://openweathermap.org)

## Deployment Links

I have deployed this project on [surge](http://steadfast-suit.surge.sh)
